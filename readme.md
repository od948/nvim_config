This is my nvim setup, it is very basic at them moment as I learn how to set it up correctly and the way I want it to be setup. This will take some time...

I think a lot of the configuration inside the init.lua file can be moved into respective plugin files inside there setup files. This will be a bit of effort however and I don't know if I want to do that yet. 

Next up to add now that I have LSP's and Autocomplete I think is git-tools and code manipulation tools.
